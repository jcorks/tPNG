Import of test PNGs from libpng to test tPNG's reading abilities.
Most of these tests from libpng come from http://www.schaik.com/pngsuite/
Some of them are personal image tests from typical sources.




Here, each PNG file in this directory has an RGBA data equivalent within the 
"rawdata" directory that matches. The test (driver.c) will open 
every PNG and compare the raw RGBA values against the raw data 
equivalent.

If A test fails, the program will print "TEST FAILED" with more information 
to stdout and will exit. If all tests pass, the program returns 
"The test is complete.\n".

Every major commit should be checked with these tests, and 
further tests should be added using the existing patterns here.




To run the tests:

 -  Run make in this directory.
 -  Run the resultant test.exe


Alternatively, driver.c and tpng.c compiled together 
with your compiler will be sufficient to produce the 
text program in the case that GCC and GNUmake isn't available.
